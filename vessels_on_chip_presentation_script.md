**Total Duration: 8:00 minutes**

## [0:00-0:45] INTRODUCTION & HOOK (45 seconds)

*[Point to fluorescence microscopy image on poster]*

"Good morning everyone. What you see here is not a human blood vessel observed under a microscope, but an artificial reproduction created in a laboratory. Today, I'm going to present vessels-on-chip, a revolutionary microfluidic technology that allows us to recreate human blood vessels in vitro with unprecedented precision.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 18 million deaths annually. To develop new treatments, we need models that faithfully reproduce human physiology. This is where vessels-on-chip come in."

## [0:45-1:15] WHAT ARE VESSELS-ON-CHIPS? (30 seconds)

*[Point to title and definition on poster]*

"So, what exactly are vessels-on-chips? They are functional human blood vessels recreated on microfluidic chips. These are miniaturized laboratory devices that use microscale channels to culture living cells in conditions that closely mimic the human body.

The key innovation is that we can recreate the three-dimensional architecture, the blood flow, and the mechanical environment of real blood vessels—all on a chip the size of a USB stick."

## [1:15-2:45] KEY COMPONENTS & FABRICATION (1 minute 30 seconds)

*[Point to "Key Components" table on poster]*

"A vessel-on-chip consists of three main components:

**First, the microchannels**, made from PDMS—polydimethylsiloxane. This is a transparent, biocompatible polymer that is also gas-permeable, allowing oxygen exchange. These channels are 10 to 200 micrometers in diameter, matching the actual size of human capillaries and arterioles.

**Second, the endothelial cells**—these are the cells that naturally line the inside of our blood vessels. We use either primary cells like HUVECs—Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells—or, and this is a recent innovation from Helmholtz Munich, cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs. This opens the door to personalized medicine.

**Third, the extracellular matrix**—a 3D hydrogel made of collagen or fibrin that mimics the connective tissue surrounding vessels and enables critical cell-matrix interactions.

*[Point to "Fabrication Process" diagram on poster]*

The fabrication follows four steps:

**Day 0 - Microfabrication**: We create the channels using soft lithography—molding PDMS over a master pattern.

**Day 1 - Cell seeding**: Endothelial cells are injected and adhere to the channel walls.

**Days 1-14 - Perfusion**: Culture medium is continuously pumped through, creating laminar flow.

**Day 14+ - Maturation**: After 5 to 14 days, we obtain a functional vessel with a continuous endothelial monolayer.

The result? A living, perfusable mini-blood vessel that we can observe in real-time under a microscope."

## [2:45-3:30] HOW IT WORKS—PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES (45 seconds)

*[Point to equations or technical aspects section on poster]*

"These devices reproduce the real physical phenomena of microcirculation:

Mass transport occurs through two mechanisms:
- **Diffusion** following Fick's law—oxygen crosses the vascular wall toward tissues.
- **Convection**—flow transports nutrients and waste products.

We characterize these phenomena with two dimensionless numbers:

The **Péclet number**—the ratio of convection to diffusion. If Pe is greater than 1, convection dominates, as in arterioles. If Pe is less than 1, diffusion dominates, as in capillaries.

The **Reynolds number**—in microcirculation, Re is very low, less than 1, ensuring laminar flow. This is crucial because turbulent flow is pathological.

The beauty of these models is that we can manipulate these parameters independently—impossible to do in vivo."

## [3:30-5:15] CONCRETE APPLICATIONS (1 minute 45 seconds)

*[Point to "Applications" section with images on poster]*

"Vessels-on-chip have numerous applications. Let me highlight the main ones:

**1. Cardiovascular research with personalized models**
The team at Helmholtz Munich has developed iPSC-derived vessels that allow patient-specific modeling. They've modeled atherosclerosis by exposing stem cells to oxidized LDL and free fatty acids, reproducing the early stages of the disease. The advantage of stem cells? We can create personalized models to test individualized treatments.

**2. Pharmacological testing**
We can perfuse whole blood to study thrombosis—blood clotting. We can test the efficacy of chemotherapies or predict the vascular toxicity of new drugs. The Wyss Institute has even connected 10 organs-on-chip together to reproduce the systemic pharmacokinetics of the human body—how drugs are processed throughout multiple organs.

**3. Angiogenesis studies**
We can create a gradient of VEGF—vascular endothelial growth factor—and observe in real-time as cells migrate and form new capillaries. This is critical for understanding how tumors become vascularized and develop blood supply.

**4. Tissue barrier modeling**
For example, the blood-brain barrier. We co-culture brain endothelial cells with astrocytes. This allows us to test which drugs can cross the barrier to treat Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. The Wyss Institute's lung-on-chip even integrates mechanical stretching to mimic breathing."

## [5:15-6:30] ALTERNATIVES COMPARISON (1 minute 15 seconds)

*[Point to "Other Methods" section on poster]*

"How do vessels-on-chip compare to alternatives?

**Versus Animal Models**
Animal models provide complete physiological context, but 70% of results don't translate to humans. For example, mouse placenta functions differently from human placenta. They're also expensive—200 to 1000 euros per experiment—and ethically problematic.

**Versus 2D Culture**
2D cell culture is simple, inexpensive, and high-throughput. But there's no 3D architecture, no flow, and low physiological relevance—cells grow flat on plastic.

**Versus 3D Bioprinting**
3D bioprinting allows more complex geometries and thick vascularized tissues. However, vessels-on-chip offer better geometric control at the micrometer level and are less costly.

Vessels-on-chip represent an optimal compromise: precise control, biological relevance, and accessibility."

## [6:30-7:15] LIMITATIONS (45 seconds)

*[Point to "Limitations" section on poster]*

"Of course, this technology has limitations we must acknowledge:

**Technical limitations**: PDMS absorbs certain hydrophobic drugs, which can skew pharmacological tests. Most models use culture medium, not whole blood with red blood cells.

**Biological limitations**: It's difficult to reproduce complete complexity—the immune system, innervation, hormonal signaling. Long-term vascular remodeling, which takes months or years in vivo, is not yet well captured.

**Practical limitations**: Technical expertise is required—2 to 4 weeks of training. Initial equipment cost ranges from 20,000 to 100,000 euros. Throughput is limited—5 to 20 chips per experiment versus 96 to 384 conditions in multi-well plates.

These challenges are being actively addressed by the scientific community."

## [7:15-8:00] PERSPECTIVES & CONCLUSION (45 seconds)

*[Point to "Perspectives" section on poster]*

"The future of vessels-on-chip is promising:

**Short-term**: Regulatory validation by the FDA and EMA as alternatives to animal testing, with ISO standards expected between 2025 and 2027.

**Medium-term**: Personalized medicine—using your own stem cells to test treatments before you receive them.

**Long-term**: Comprehensive body-on-chips systems reproducing the entire human body to predict systemic drug interactions.

*[Return to center, face audience]*

In conclusion, vessels-on-chip won't completely replace animal models or clinical research, but they represent a crucial bridge between fundamental research and translational medicine. They offer an ethical, economical, and scientifically robust platform to study vascular diseases and develop new treatments.

Thank you for your attention. Any questions?"
